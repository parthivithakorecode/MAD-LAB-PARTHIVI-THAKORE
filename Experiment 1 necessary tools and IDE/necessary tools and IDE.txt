Step-by-Step guide to install all the necessary tools and IDE required for setting up mobile application development using the Flutter framework:

Step 1: Install Flutter SDK

1.Download the Flutter SDK:
   - Go to the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and download the Flutter SDK for your operating system.

2.Extract the Flutter SDK:
   - Extract the downloaded file to a suitable location on your system (`C:\src\flutter` on Windows).

3.Update your PATH:
   - Add the Flutter bin directory to your system PATH.
    
       1. Open the Start Search, type in “env”, and select “Edit the system environment variables”.
       2. In the System Properties window, click on the “Environment Variables” button.
       3. Under “System variables”, find the `PATH` variable and click “Edit”.
       4. Add the full path to `flutter\bin` (e.g., `C:\src\flutter\bin`).
     

Step 2: Install Dart SDK (included with Flutter)

- The Dart SDK is included in the Flutter SDK, so no additional installation is required.

 Step 3: Install Android Studio

1.Download and Install Android Studio:
   - Go to the [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio) and download the installer for your operating system.
   
2. Set up Android Studio:
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Go to `Configure` > `SDK Manager`.
   - Ensure you have the `Android SDK`, `Android SDK Platform-Tools`, and `Android SDK Build-Tools` installed.
   - Install the Android emulator, if necessary, from the `SDK Tools` tab.

3. Configure Android Studio with Flutter:
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Go to `Plugins` > `Marketplace`.
   - Search for `Flutter` and install the Flutter plugin.
   - Android Studio will prompt to install the Dart plugin. Confirm and install it.

### Step 4: Set Up an Emulator or Connect a Device

1. **Set up an Android Emulator**:
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Go to `AVD Manager` (you can find it in the `Configure` menu).
   - Click on `Create Virtual Device`.
   - Choose a device definition and a system image, then follow the prompts to complete the setup.
   - Start the emulator.

2. **Connect a Physical Device**:
   - Enable `Developer Options` and `USB Debugging` on your Android device.
   - Connect your device to your computer via USB.

Step 5: Verify Installation

1.Run Flutter Doctor:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     bash
     flutter doctor
     
   - This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It will also highlight any issues you need to address.

Step 6: Create and Run a Flutter Project

1. Create a New Flutter Project:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     bash
     flutter create my_app
     
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     bash
     cd my_app
     

2. Run the Flutter Project**:
   - Ensure an emulator is running or a physical device is connected.
   - Run the following command:
     bash
     flutter run
     

This completes the setup for mobile application development using the Flutter framework. You are now ready to start developing Flutter applications!
